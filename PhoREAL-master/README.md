<h1>PhoREAL</h1>
<h5>Tools to make ICESat-2 ATL03 and ATL08 analysis easier</h5>

PhoREAL (Photon Research and Engineering Analysis Library) is a geospatial analysis toolbox that allows users to read, process, analyze, and output ICESat-2 ATL03 and ATL08 data in the form of figures and .las, .csv, and .kml files. 

<h3>PhoREAL v3.28</h3>

The new features available in PhoREAL v3.28 include: 
* Batch mode capability (can process single/multiple ATL03/ATL08 file(s) or a directory of ATL03/ATL08 files)
* Incorporation of ICESat-2 Orthometric (Mean Sea Level) heights (computed using EGM2008 ellipsoid)
* Addition of latitude/longitude, time, and delta time for reference data
* Addition of latitude/longitude, time, delta time, classification, and signal confidence for shifted ICESat-2 data
* Clearer plotting of stats onto figures
* Ability to load in files previously executed by PhoREAL for quicker plotting and analysis 
* Additional ground track inputs including beam number and ground track strong/weak beam
* Additional output columns to .csv file (solar elevation, UTM zone, UTM hemi, GT #, beam #, beam type)
* New Stats tab to compute stats on ICESat-2 data
* Option to write out .pkl file for saving output variables



Note: On Windows systems, the PhoREAL toolbox can be run as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) executable (.exe). On Linux systems, the PhoREAL toolbox can be run as a Python GUI or as a series of Python function commands via
the Linux command line
